# GangaGuards
GangaGuard is an AI-driven river-cleanliness system that detects garbage using YOLOv8 and sends real-time alerts to a backend. A React Native/Expo mobile app allows users to accept cleanup tasks, upload proof, and earn points. The platform enables fast, community-powered cleanup of the Ganga River.
